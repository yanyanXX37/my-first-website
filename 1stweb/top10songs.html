            <td width="50%">Happiness (Taylor swift)</td>
            <td>Perfectly encapsulates the feeling of accepting someones departure. Accepting that you both hurt each other and accepting that you both found happiness with one another and will find happiness in other people as well.</td>

            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Can't catch me now (Olivia Rodrigo)</td>
            <td>When you leave someone and you know you left a mark that will haunt them forever.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Futile Devices (Sufjan Stevens)</td>
            <td>I think this song is very beautiful. It explains something I can't. What happens when words can't capture how you feel? What happens when words become futile devices in communicating love? Action and consistency is a better language than any other language known to man.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Ribs (Lorde)</td>
            <td>At the end of the day, the love of a friend is better than a love of a lover. This proved to me that no matter how many partners you go through, the same people who will always love you will be the friends that you made along the way. The friends that you grew up with. And the friends that you'll make.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Matilda (Harry Styles)</td>
            <td>Growing up without a proper family, Matilda hit the right spots. This song tells you that it's okay to start over. It's okay to forget those who don't support and has never supported you before, even if they're biologically ur family. Family is in the heart and amount of love, not blood.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Monster (Adventure Time)</td>
            <td>This song is about fear of being in love. I relate to it because with the current dating scene, love feels like a trick. Love feels superficial. Love is just a word. Monster encapsulates that fear. The fear of being in love and getting hurt and going soft for someone, especially if everyone nowadays is a monster BUT still choosing to love despite the hurt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Geronimo (Sheppard)</td>
            <td>Everytime I hear this song, I feel like I'm running through a seashore, fireworks blowing up above me. Pure adrenaline, pure joy, pure life. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Don't stop me now (QUEEN)</td>
            <td>SPITE! It's all I can think of when I listen to this song. You think I can't do it? You think I'm not capable of doing something like that? Watch me.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Swimming Pools (Kendrick Lamar)</td>
            <td>My favorite kendrick song. The wordplay, the rhyme, the beat, its fucking good is all I can say</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>➤</td>
            <td width="50%">Hurt (Newjeans)</td>
            <td>Words are nice, but actions are better. This song taught me to not invest too much until I see action. To not play cat and mouse games with possible partners because all it ends up with is me being hurt. So until action is taken, nothing will happen.</td>
        </tr>
